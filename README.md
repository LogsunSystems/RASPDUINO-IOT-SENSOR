# RASPDUINO-IOT-SENSOR

This experimental kit provides you the facility to check and verify your IOT projects on **ARDUINO** and **RASPBERRY PI** on a single board.

##**INTRODUCTION**

* IOT (Internet of Things) is an advanced automation and analytics system which exploits networking, sensing, big data, and artificial intelligence technology to deliver complete systems for a product or service. These systems allow greater transparency, control, and performance when applied to any industry or system.

* IOT systems have applications across industries through their unique flexibility and ability to be suitable in any environment. They enhance data collection, automation, operations, and much more through smart devices and powerful enabling technology.
